    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ever have a pesky customer that you wish you could just keep in a jar? 
        Or maybe you need to sneak through a tiny crack in a wall? 
        Every respectable witch needs a go to shrink potion recipe. 
        This recipe has been passed through my family for generations of witches and works dependably regardless of how long its been stored. 
        Drink one bottle of it and get shrunk down to 5% of your original height within minutes, with effects lasting up to 4 hours. 
        <br> If you enjoy this recipe please consider adding a five-star review.
        <br><br> Cheers!
